description: Clarify and route inbox items (GTD PROCESS)
---

Execute the gtd skill PROCESS workflow.

Trigger: "process inbox"

## Mode

**Default: Interactive micro-ritual**

- Process one item at a time
- Present capture → Propose routing → Confirm with user → Execute
- User controls pace (can pause anytime)

**Batch mode:** Only if user explicitly says "batch" or "process all automatically"

## Critical Rule

**NEVER make autonomous routing decisions.** Each inbox item requires user involvement in the clarify and decide stages. This is the point of GTD processing - intentional engagement with each commitment.

Processing is a micro-ritual. Not automation.
