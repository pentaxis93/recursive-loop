description: Park an open decision/issue with full context for later
---

Park an in-progress design decision, open question, or blocked issue.

Creates structured capture with:

- Context (what led here)
- Changes made (if any)
- Arguments for/against
- Open questions
- Restoration path
- Status: awaiting [specified input]

Output: `{{brainFolder}}/00-inbox/capture-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.md` with `status: in-progress`

Use when: work is blocked pending external input (voice notes, research, user decision) but context must be preserved for seamless resumption.
