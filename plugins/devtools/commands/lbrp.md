# LBRP

The full ceremonial opening. Use when starting any coding session.

**Trigger:** Say "open" or invoke `/devtools:lbrp`

Executes the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram:

1. **Phase 0a:** Observe workspace status (git, worktrees, processes)
2. **Phase 0b:** Establish session goal (the sacred center)
3. **Phase 1:** Banish debris (clear what doesn't serve the goal)
4. **Phase 2:** Address four quarters (Context, Tasks, Workspace, Environment)
5. **Phase 3:** Return to center (confirm alignment)

See `skills/lbrp.md` for full protocol.
