description: Four-pass cognitive method extraction via topology observation
---

# Observe Self

**The central technique.** Apply Fourth Way self-observation to extract and encode cognitive methods as reusable skills, commands, or sutras.

## The Core Insight

This is not optimization. It's observation.
Each pass increases resolution on what IS, not what should be.

You're not editing. You're photographing.
Each pass sharpens the image.

---

## Guard Clause

**Before Pass 1:** If interaction is trivial (< 3 turns, no novel method detected), exit with `NO_INSIGHTS_FOUND`.

---

## Four-Pass Topology Extraction

**Input:** Session context or specific interaction where a novel method emerged.

---

### Pass 1: WITNESS — Pure Impartial Observation

Describe what happened without judgment or analysis.

- What were the cognitive moves?
- What was the sequence of thought?
- What shifted? What held?

**Output:** A narrative of the actual thinking that occurred.

**Note:** Resist the urge to evaluate. Just witness.
The alchemical fire comes from attention, not analysis.

---

### Pass 2: LOCATE — Find the Inflection

Where was the moment of shift?

- What made this different from ordinary processing?
- Where was the "click" or "unlock"?
- What did *this* thinking do that *typical* thinking doesn't?

**Output:** The identified moment/move that worked.

### Pass 3: MAP — Extract the Topology

Strip away domain. What's the bare cognitive structure?

- What transformation occurred between input and output?
- What's the essential geometric relationship?
- If this were a function, what would its signature be?

**Output:** The abstract shape—the topology of the method.

**Key question:** "If I removed all the content, what would be left? What's the skeleton?"

---

### Pass 4: ENCODE — Make It Reproducible

Now—and only now—formalize.

- What triggers indicate this method applies?
- What are the steps someone else would follow?
- What are the boundary conditions?
- What's the minimal instruction set?

**Action:**

1. Determine artifact type: `Skill` (complex), `Command` (simple), or `Sutra` (principle)
2. Write to `.claude/skills/{kebab-case-name}.md` or `.claude/commands/`
3. Notify user: "New skill [Name] has been forged."

**Output:** Skill, command, or sutra written to disk.
