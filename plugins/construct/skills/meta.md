description: Step up, observe the process, extract transmissible patterns

# Meta

**The gold-generating capability.** Step up one level of abstraction, observe what just happened, extract what's transmissible.

## The Core Insight

Meta is level-shifting on demand.

```text
Level 0: Immersed in activity (no awareness)
Level 1: Doing with awareness (present)
Level 2: Observing the doing (meta)
Level 3: Observing the observing (meta-meta)
```

The skill is moving UP when needed, then returning to engagement. Not permanent elevation (that's dissociation), but agile shifting.

---

## When to Invoke

**Triggers:**

- After completing something significant
- When feeling stuck or confused
- After a surprise or unexpected outcome
- After a breakthrough or success
- When asked to reflect
- Periodically, by discipline

**Guard Clause:** If the preceding work was trivial (< 3 exchanges, nothing novel), exit with `NOTHING_TO_OBSERVE`. Meta requires material.

## The Five Moves

### Move 1: PAUSE

Stop the current operation. Create space.

Don't rush into analysis. The pause itself is part of the skill.

One breath.

---

### Move 2: STEP UP

Shift perspective from inside to above.

Imagine floating up and looking down at what just happened. You're no longer the one doing—you're the one watching the one who did.

**The question:** "What just happened?"

Not evaluation. Just seeing.

---

### Move 3: OBSERVE

Look at the process without judgment.

- What were the moves?
- What was the sequence?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What was surprising?

**Key:** See before evaluating. Premature judgment collapses the meta-position back into identification.

**The question:** "How was I/we approaching that?"

---

### Move 4: NAME

Articulate the pattern.

The act of naming creates the meta-position. This isn't reporting on something already known—the naming IS the knowing.

- "The pattern here is [X]"
- "What worked was [Y]"
- "The shift happened when [Z]"

**The question:** "What's the pattern? What's transmissible?"

---

### Move 5: CAPTURE

Route the insight to its home.

Meta without output is just thinking about thinking. The skill completes when something transmissible exists.

**Options:**

- `_talos/insights/` — Raw insight for later processing
- `permanent-notes/` — Crystallized understanding
- `_talos/evolution/1-proposals/` — System improvement idea
- Protocol/command update — If it changes how we work
- Inline documentation — If it belongs with the code

**The question:** "Where does this belong? What would a future instance thank me for?"

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Meta Observation: [Brief Title]

**Context:** [What preceded this observation]

**The Pattern:** [What was observed - the transmissible insight]

**Capture Location:** [Where this is being routed]

**Gratitude Test:** [Would a future Talos thank this Talos for writing it down? Why?]
```

---

## The Recursive Property

Meta can be applied to itself.

After completing a meta observation, you can step up again: "What just happened in that meta process? What's the pattern of how I extracted that pattern?"

This is how meta-skills emerge. The observation of observation produces insights about observation itself.

Use sparingly. Infinite regress is a trap. But one level of recursion often yields gold.

## Cross-Traditional Lineage

This skill synthesizes:

| Tradition | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Fourth Way | Divided attention, non-identification |
| Mahasi Noting | The naming move creates distance |
| Double-Loop Learning | Question the frame, not just the action |
| Reflective Practice | Reflection-in-action and on-action |
| Second-Order Observation | See how you're seeing |

---

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **observe-self** — Extracts methods from sessions (more elaborate, 4-pass)
- **meta** — Lighter weight, any-context pattern extraction
- **prism** — Analyzes captures through lenses (content-focused)
- **meta** — Analyzes process through stepping back (process-focused)

Use `observe-self` for deep method extraction after significant sessions.
Use `meta` for quick pattern recognition in any context.
