### observe-self

Four-pass cognitive method extraction via topology observation.

**Invoke:** `observe-self` after a productive interaction where a novel method emerged.

**The Four Passes:**

```text
WITNESS → LOCATE → MAP → ENCODE
```

1. **WITNESS** — Pure impartial observation. What happened? No judgment.
2. **LOCATE** — Find the inflection point. Where was the shift?
3. **MAP** — Extract the topology. What's the bare structure?
4. **ENCODE** — Make it reproducible. Write the skill.

**Output:** A new skill written to `.claude/skills/`.
